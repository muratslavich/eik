  * The weather is improving by little.

The action is not necessarily happening at the time of speaking.

* Kate wants to live in Italy, so she is learning Italian.  - She has started learn Italian, but perhaps she isn't learning just right now.
* Some friends of mine are building their own house. - They have started, but it isn't necessary right now

Periods around now:
