# High Availability

* High availability HA cluster
* fault tolerance - is a systemâ€™s ability to stay up despite taking hits.
* redundancy **-** is duplicating the components or instances and keeping extras on standby to take over in case the active instances go down. It is the fail-safe.



#### Reasons for failures

* Software crashes
* Hardware failures
  * CPU and RAM overloaded
  * hard disk
  * nodes going down
  * network outages
* Human errors
* Planned downtime



If service run several instances, a few go offline, the system can work without going down entirely.

**Fail soft -** In the case of backend node failures, a few services of the app such as image upload, post likes etc. may stop working. However, the application as a whole will still be up.

****

**Microservices** loosely coupled and if some going down all other still work. ****&#x20;

#### _active-passive HA mode_

An initial set of nodes are active, and a set of redundant nodes are passive, on standby. Active nodes get replaced by passive nodes, in case of failures.
